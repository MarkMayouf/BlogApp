## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AIChatbox.jsx          # Main AI chatbox component
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Write.jsx              # Enhanced writing page with AI integration
â””â”€â”€ style.scss                 # Responsive styles for AI features
```

### Key Functions

#### AIChatbox Component

- **`sendMessage()`**: Handles AI API communication
- **`applyToEditor()`**: Integrates AI content with the editor
- **`handleKeyPress()`**: Manages keyboard shortcuts
- **`clearChat()`**: Resets chat history

#### Write Component

- **`handleAISuggestion()`**: Processes AI content and adds it to the article
- **`toggleChatbox()`**: Controls chatbox visibility

### AI Integration Flow

1. User types a question or request in the chatbox
2. Input is sent to Google Gemini Pro model with specialized prompts
3. AI generates contextual writing assistance
4. Response is displayed in the chat with formatting
5. User can apply suggestions directly to the article editor

## Responsive Design

The AI assistant is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:

### Desktop (>1024px)
- Fixed positioning on the right side
- Full-featured chatbox with optimal dimensions
- Complete functionality and controls

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- Slightly smaller chatbox
- Maintains all functionality
- Optimized button sizes for touch

### Mobile (<768px)
- Full-screen chatbox overlay
- Touch-optimized interface
- Prevents zoom on input focus
- Easy close/minimize options

## API Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for AI features
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# This key is used by:
# - AIChatbox component for AI communication
# - Content generation and improvement features
# - Real-time writing assistance
```

### Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables (not in code)
- Keys are not exposed in the client-side bundle
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- No sensitive data is transmitted to AI services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API key not configured" Error**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists in the client directory
   - Verify `REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Restart the development server after adding the key

2. **AI Responses Not Working**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify API key is valid and active
   - Check browser console for error messages

3. **Chatbox Not Appearing**
   - Ensure you're on the Write page (`/write`)
   - Click the "ðŸ¤– AI Assistant" button
   - Check if there are any JavaScript errors in console

### Performance Optimization

- AI requests are debounced to prevent spam
- Chat history is managed efficiently
- Responsive design minimizes layout shifts
- Error boundaries prevent crashes
